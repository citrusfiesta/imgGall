# Interactive image gallery in AS3.

An interactive image gallery with a grid based overview of thumbnail. Clicking on a thumbnail loads in the full image linked to it.

Images show some text and there are two versions of one images: one in English, one in Dutch. Once the full images is loaded navigation buttons appear to scroll through the images, go back to the menu, or switch languages.

All transitions will be done with tweens. I have never used them before. Also, I haven't used ActionScript and Flash in a long while, so we'll see how it goes :p
